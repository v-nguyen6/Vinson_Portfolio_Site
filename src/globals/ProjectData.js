The development process for the movie app was by far the most interesting as we utilized both functional components as well as class components when building the site. We were looking to challenge ourselves by trying to better our understanding of React by trying to demonstrate the past of React as well as the future.",
        challenge: 
            "One of our biggest obstacles was not only learning React functional components and React hooks, but why they are superior to React class components. As a challenge, we compared implementing these features using both methods. Although it was interesting that we were able to mesh two different ways and approaches to React, it overall proved challenging and at times cumbersome as it made for a more complicated structure. Overall this was a great learning process because we were able to develop the ability to understand which concept may be better during a specific part of development.",

We also used plugins such as Advanced Custom Fields to add further functionality to the site. The Woocommerce aspect of the site was used to create the overall feel of a real ecommerce site which allowed users to add products to cart as well as go through the entire ordering and payment process.",

I then created wireframes with a mobile first approach in mind using Adobe XD. My goal in my design approach was to try and build upon functionality that can be completed efficiently and effectively in React JS. In this stage of the process it was important to me that the elements that I wanted to create and include in the layout could be mapped out and or visualized as components.",

The main takeaway and outline of the development phase was utilizing hooks and props in order to effectively and efficiently call data from another file to be used in templates that I created to be outputted. This method not only made the overall code more efficient, but was able to highlight the usefulness of React and components.",

On the technical side, it was also challenging to see which parts of the code best exemplified my skills and knowledge.",

That being said, the contact and or inquiry form was one of the few areas of the site that challenged us as a team.

The design of the game was fleshed out to fit the theme of dinosaurs with a related background as well as related game pieces, and in game elements.",
        development: 
            "The development of the game utilized many various Javascript principles such as adding the inclusion of Components, Controllers, Obstacles, Movement and Gravity. The overall development of the game was fairly linear, as we started with creating the game canvas, then we started to add other elements that would build onto the game. This would include then creating components for the both the main character, and then obstacles. After the main game elements were created, extra features that would bring the game together, such as the moving background as well as the implementation of gravity was included to make the game feel more refined.",
        challenge: 
            "Although the development side of the game was fairly straight-forward, we began running into issues with creating hit detection within the game. Our original base version of the game was a simplified version using only shapes that were created using HTML and CSS. Because we wanted to include the custom character PNGs that we created, when we got to the point of implementation, we found it difficult in the begining to create a game that felt like it worked correctly. The main issue was the main character sprite/PNG had transparency that bordered the actual character, that we then had to take into account. This main issue was probably due to the fact that the sides of the character were shorter than the corresponding height of the character. If the sides of the character reached the corners the of the top and or bottom of a squared shape, there wouldn't be any issues.",
